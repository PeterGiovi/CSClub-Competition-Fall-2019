# CSClub-Competition-Fall-2019

The Only File in this repository that is my work is the "robot.java" file, which was my submission for this contest and was the winning solution. 

The other files in this repository are a PDF containing the instructions for the problem, and test scripts to run the submission and judge its performance. These files were all provided by the CS Club at SUNY Polytechnic.
